# üìä Statistics: An Overview
# ---------------------------------------------
# Statistics is a branch of mathematics used for collecting, analyzing,
# interpreting, and presenting data. It plays a crucial role in various fields:

# - Business & Economics: Market analysis, financial forecasting, customer behavior.
# - Medicine: Clinical trials, health research, epidemiology.
# - Government & Politics: Public opinion surveys, election predictions, policy analysis.
# - Climate & Weather: Forecasting, trend analysis, environmental studies.
# - Everyday Life: Decision-making, risk assessment, quality control.

# ---------------------------------------------
# üî¢ Types of Statistics
# ---------------------------------------------

# 1. Descriptive Statistics:
#    - Summarizes and describes the main features of a dataset.
#    - Examples: Mean, median, mode, range, variance, standard deviation.

# 2. Inferential Statistics:
#    - Makes predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample.
#    - Concepts:
#      - Population: Entire group of interest.
#      - Sample: Subset of the population.
#    - Important considerations:
#      - Sample Size: Sufficient to represent the population.
#      - Randomness: Ensures each member has an equal chance of selection.
#      - Representativeness: Reflects the characteristics of the population.

# üßÆ Types of Data
# ---------------------------------------------

# 1. Categorical (Qualitative) Data:
#    - Nominal: Categories without a specific order (e.g., gender, color).
#    - Ordinal: Categories with a specific order (e.g., satisfaction ratings).

# 2. Numerical (Quantitative) Data:
#    - Discrete: Countable values (e.g., number of students).
#    - Continuous: Measurable values (e.g., height, weight).

# ---------------------------------------------
# üìç Measures of Central Tendency
# ---------------------------------------------

# - Mean: Average of all values.
#   - Formula: Mean = (Sum of all values) / (Number of values)
#   - Note: Sensitive to outliers.

# - Median: Middle value when data is arranged in order.
#   - For odd number of values: Middle value.
#   - For even number of values: Average of two middle values.

# - Mode: Most frequently occurring value.

# ---------------------------------------------
# üìà Measures of Dispersion
# ---------------------------------------------

# - Range: Difference between the maximum and minimum values.
#   - Formula: Range = Max value - Min value
#   - Note: Sensitive to outliers.

# - Variance: Average of the squared differences from the mean.
#   - Formula: Variance = Œ£(x_i - mean)¬≤ / N

# - Standard Deviation: Square root of the variance.
#   - Formula: SD = ‚àöVariance
#   - Note: Same units as the data.

# - Coefficient of Variation (CV): Ratio of the standard deviation to the mean, expressed as a percentage.
#   - Formula: CV = (SD / Mean) * 100%

# - Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD): Average of the absolute differences from the mean.
#   - Formula: MAD = Œ£|x_i - mean| / N

# ---------------------------------------------
# üìä Frequency Distribution Table
# ---------------------------------------------

# - A table that summarizes the number of occurrences of each value or range of values in a dataset.
#   - Helps in understanding the distribution and patterns within the data.

# Note: When working with data, it's essential to choose the appropriate
# measures and techniques based on the nature of the data and the objectives of the analysis.

# ---------------------------------------------
# üì¶ Frequency, Relative and Cumulative Frequency (Categorical Data)
# ---------------------------------------------
# - Frequency: Count of occurrences in each category.
# - Relative Frequency: Frequency relative to the total (percentage).
# - Cumulative Frequency: Running total of frequencies.

# ---------------------------------------------
# üóÉÔ∏è Binning and Histograms
# ---------------------------------------------
# - You have to create categories and bins for numerical data.
# - This is typically visualized using histograms.

# Histogram Shapes:
# - Symmetric
# - Bimodal
# - Left-Skewed
# - Right-Skewed
# - Uniform
# - No clear pattern

# ---------------------------------------------
# üîÑ Graphs for Bivariate Analysis
# ---------------------------------------------
# 1. Categorical vs Categorical:
#    - Use contingency tables / cross tabs.
#    - Summarize the relationship between two categorical variables in a frequency table.

# 2. Numerical vs Numerical:
#    - Use scatter plots to visualize correlation or patterns.

# 3. Categorical vs Numerical:
#    - Use bar charts to compare numerical values across categories.
