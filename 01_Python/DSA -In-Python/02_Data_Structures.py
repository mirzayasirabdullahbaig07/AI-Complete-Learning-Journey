# What are Data Structures and why are they so important?
# Data Structures are ways to store and organize data efficiently
# so we can access and modify it quickly and effectively.

# Why do I need Data Structures and Algorithms?
# Because they help you solve problems efficiently — saving both time and space.
# Almost every senior developer will advise you to master DSA if you want to become a great software engineer.

# Why do I need Array, Linked List, Stack, Trees, and Graphs?
# These structures allow you to write optimized and scalable code for real-world problems.

# Let's understand the importance of DSA with some real examples shared by seniors:

# Senior 1: File Browsing System
# Suppose you're building an operating system that browses files.
# A folder can contain more folders and files, and this can go on recursively.
# You could use loops and recursion, but that might result in inefficient code.
# The better approach is to use a Tree data structure, which is built for hierarchical data.

# Senior 2: Social Media Friend Suggestions
# You're creating a social media app and want to suggest friends to users.
# While basic logic may work, there's a better solution.
# Use Graphs — a data structure designed for relationships and connections.
# Graph algorithms are perfect for building features like friend suggestions.

# Senior 3: Web Browser Navigation
# Imagine you're building a browser with a feature to go from one website to another,
# and allow users to go back to the previous pages.
# A Stack (LIFO - Last In First Out) is the best choice here.
# It helps manage the back and forward navigation efficiently.
# Similarly, if you're building a text editor with Undo and Redo features,
# you can use two stacks to manage those actions cleanly.

# Linear vs Non-Linear Data Structures

# Linear Data Structures:
# Store data in a sequential way, one element after another.
# Examples: Array, Stack, Queue, Linked List, Hashing

# Non-Linear Data Structures:
# Store data in a hierarchical or interconnected way.
# Examples: Tree, Graph

# Summary:
# DSA is not just for coding interviews. It’s essential for building optimized,
# real-world applications. Mastering DSA helps you become a strong and efficient software engineer.
